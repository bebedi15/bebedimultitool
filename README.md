# 🛠️ Bebedi Tool

Bebedi Tool is a Python open source code that includes several features for Roblox users. This tool was made for fun and it includes the following features:

- 🔍 Group Finder
- 🔍 Group Finder v2
- 📜 Group Username Scraper
- 💡 Username Generator

## Features

### 🔍 Group Finder

The group finder feature allows users to find groups on Roblox without an owner that they can claim. Users can search for groups based on specific search criteria, such as keyword, minimum and maximum member count, and language. The tool can automatically use a proxy pool or the user can provide their own proxies.

### 🔍 Group Finder v2

The group finder v2 feature is faster than the original group finder, which may slow down the network. The user must provide their proxies in the proxies.txt file.

### 📜 Group Username Scraper

The group username scraper feature allows users to scrape the usernames of members in a specific Roblox group. The usernames are saved in a file in the output folder.

### 💡 Username Generator

The username generator feature creates random usernames that are avaible to use.

## Requirements

- colorama
- concurrent-futures
- requests

## Output

The output for each feature is saved in the output folder.
